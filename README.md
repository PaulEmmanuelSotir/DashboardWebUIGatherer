# DashboardWebUIGatherer
Merges/Gathers multiple web UIs listening on a server or localhost into a simple single Web App. The original goal of this Web UI was to simplify usage of multiple DataScience/ML Web UIs; e.g. Gathering Tensorboard, Jupyter Notbooks, MLFlow Web UI, NNI Web UI, Data Dashboards, ... into a single web app in a simple and generic way.
